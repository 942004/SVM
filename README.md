# Machine Learning Model with SVM

## Description
This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier using **scikit-learn** to analyze email-related features. The model predicts email characteristics based on attributes such as email length, number of special characters, and uppercase letter count.

## Features
- Uses **pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing.
- Implements **scikit-learn's SVM classifier** for predictions.
- Utilizes **matplotlib** for visualization.
- Includes performance metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook untitled8.ipynb
```
